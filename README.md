# GraphQL Project in Ruby

This project demonstrates how to create and consume a GraphQL API using Ruby. It includes the setup for a GraphQL server and client, providing examples of how to query and mutate data through the API.

## Requirements

- Ruby (version 3.x)
- Bundler
- Required Gems (defined in the `Gemfile`)

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/graphql-ruby-project.git
cd graphql-ruby-project
```

### Install Dependencies

Install all the required gems using Bundler:

```bash
bundle install
```

This will install the necessary gems like `graphql` and `graphql-client`.

## Usage

### Start the GraphQL Server

To start the GraphQL server, run:

```bash
ruby server.rb
```

This will launch a local server (usually running on `http://localhost:4000`) where the GraphQL API will be available.

### Sending GraphQL Queries

Once the server is running, you can send GraphQL queries to it.

1. **Example Query** (e.g., to fetch data):

```graphql
{
  allBooks {
    title
    author
  }
}
```

2. **Example Mutation** (e.g., to create a new book):

```graphql
mutation {
  createBook(input: {title: "New Book", author: "John Doe"}) {
    book {
      title
      author
    }
  }
}
```

You can test queries and mutations by using a GraphQL client or tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com) or [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql).

### GraphQL Client

You can also interact with the GraphQL server using a Ruby client.

```ruby
# client.rb
require 'graphql/client'
require 'graphql/client/http'

HTTP = GraphQL::Client::HTTP.new("http://localhost:4000/graphql")

# Define the schema
Schema = GraphQL::Client.load_schema(HTTP)

# Define the client
Client = GraphQL::Client.new(schema: Schema, execute: HTTP)

# Example query
query = Client.parse <<-GRAPHQL
  query {
    allBooks {
      title
      author
    }
  }
GRAPHQL

response = Client.query(query)
puts response.data.all_books
```

├── client.rb         # GraphQL client code
├── README.md         # This file

```

### Dependencies

- `graphql`: Ruby gem for creating and working with GraphQL APIs.
- `graphql-client`: Ruby gem to interact with a GraphQL API from a client.
- `sinatra` (optional): Lightweight framework for the server.

## Troubleshooting

- **Issue: Server not starting**
    - Ensure that you have run `bundle install` and that the correct Ruby version is being used.
  
- **Issue: Missing dependencies**
    - Check if all dependencies are listed in the `Gemfile` and run `bundle install` to install them.
